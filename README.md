# Coding-Quiz

Using JavaScript, I created a ten question coding quiz. If you answer correctly, you get points added to your score. If you answer wrong, ten seconds are deducted from the timer. If the time runs out the game is over. Your name and score is stored in localStorage and is put on the highscores list.

Enter your name and submit your score.

Check out how you did in the Highscores list. Play again and see if you can beat your score or clear the board to hide your shame.
